# Smart7SegDisplay
The objective of the project is to design and implement such a flexible display system based on intelligent LED modules, each of them able to display one character. Each project group is responsible for delivering one display module, consisting of a LED matrix with 8x5 pixels and an Atmel AVR Atmega16 controlling it. An arbitrary number of such intelligent display modules (up to 127) should be able to work together to form a display with that size. The display modules should be connected to each other by a serial bus with as few wires as possible.
